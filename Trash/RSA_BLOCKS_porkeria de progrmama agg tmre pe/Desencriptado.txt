Day to day It wont leave Everytime I try to speak It consumes my mind It consumes my soul It wants my life it wants complete control Somebody help me before its bad Somebody help me before I end up dead I feel alone all of the time Its still quite lurking inside Im a walking contradiction Everything I say is an affliction to him Somebody help me before its bad Somebody help me before I end up dead Patrick Xavier Marquez Choque 161-10-37243AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
